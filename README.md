#### Studying Mathematics in Paris, software developer in the making...

Currently learning Haskell and specifically Plutus programming thanks to the [Plutus Pioneer Program](https://developers.cardano.org/en/plutus-pioneer-program/). I truly believe that blockchain technology can change our world for the better. Cardano's peer-reviewed and scientific rigour makes it a prime candidate for implementing blockchain in various sectors where our current models are deprecated.

I'm also very interested in Python programming, it offers a wide range of uses (back-end development, AI, ML, Data Science, ...) with a simple syntax and a support on every platform. My main project is a blockchain coded entirely in Python, the Coniunctum Cryptocurrency.

I also breifly played with web development and C++ programming, as you can see in my repositories (Yato Network is a web-app social media and ClassGenerator is a coding helper for C++). 

As I continue my studies in Computer Science Engineering, I will do my best to improve my programming skills, especially in Networking and Blockchain technology.
